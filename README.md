# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
My Goals includes the following:
1. Create a model to predict my count of restaurants given more other variables
2. To show my knowledge and understanding of using SQL in Pythin, API documentation knowldege etc.

## Process
### My first step was to go over the Project Instruction to get a good undertanding of what needed to be performed in the project
### I also utilized peers and mentors to improve my analysis mindset 
### Refered to documentation to understand python codes thta I was hoping to use
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.) The area that chose was Belfast, and there were not enough point of interest data that I could obtain from the Foursquare API. Specifically, there was no information on the ratings of the restaurants that were in my area of interets. This resulted in me relying on just the number of restaurants that were 1000m away from the bike stations from my area of interets. I feel like the lack of comparative quality limited the strength of my model.

## Challenges 
A major challenge I faced was my YELP API not working. I sort for help with mentors and peers and it was not easily fixed, which made me have to settle ot use the foursquare API

## Future Goals
1. I would spend more time on my model, I felt like my model was not strong enough considered the low score in the Adjusted R-square and the fact that all my p-value was greater than 0.05.
2. Select a new city as my area of interest, as the data I was able to obtain with the city I chose was limited. Which further limited my analysis.
